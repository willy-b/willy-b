### de Bruijn Genome Assembler "from scratch" (just Java APIs, no bioinformatics libraries)

[A de Bruijn Graph based Genome Assembler](https://github.com/willy-b/DeBruijnGenomeAssembler) intended to support assembling error-prone unpaired short reads (~100bp) into genomes up to E. Coli size on relatively cheap laptops.
Over 95% unit test line coverage with gradle CI automation.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My LinkedIn is at www.linkedin.com/in/william-bruns-5887b6132 .

My life partner's page is at https://github.com/i-am-ying-li .

Personal update:
Thankful to have been able to donate >$30,000 to the US Public Debt in 2024, added pledge to donate at least $13K/year to National Science Foundation (NSF) going forward - https://www.facebook.com/willy.bruns/posts/pfbid02L15oFAxd5bZLbonNsAVAqzFMiynTW5qFZHAw2t5qCMn77zkb2XBtAZ1vebkqXEUEl (note my overall Facebook profile which has public content is typically shadowbanned to public by FB, unclear why but started in mid-2025, but direct links typically work ).

Note: I often use the ET or UTC timezones in my commits but I am in the Pacific timezone. This is because my computer resets to an operating system base image every session and the operating system has a default timezone (Fedora 40 to 42 upgrade changed from ET to UTC), and I don't usually adjust it.

NONE of the software repositories on my GitHub were developed using any sort of AI code assistance (NO copilot for example) or review. My life partner Ying Li was also NOT involved in these projects.
